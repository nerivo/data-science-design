Yet for these benefits to be realised, data science initiatives must be designed and executed in a sensible way. Often these projects, while successful from a scientific standpoint, miss the mark in terms of business impact. Many business leaders are left feeling unsettled, balancing the need for innovation and the adoption of revolutionary technologies with an uncomfortable degree of uncertainty and risk of failure. For the data scientist the situation can be equally unnerving, with uncertainties about how to deliver a successful project when the path is not clear. Yet, these uncertainties and risks – for the business leader and the data scientist alike – can be controlled and managed if approached in a sensible manner. Your authors have designed and delivered hundreds of projects across a wide range of industries. We have made many mistakes, and in the process we have learned what works well and where the common pitfalls lie. We wrote this book to share our experiences in hopes that it will help the reader – whether a data science practitioner or a business leader – reduce these risks and design projects that have the greatest chance of success. Much of the content in this guide is derived from lessons we have given to our students. Here we have gathered, organised and expanded on those bits of advice to serve as a resource for anyone considering embarking on a data science journey. We share our approach to data science projects, addressing topics such as: alignment to business imperatives, project design, project delivery and evaluation of success. Data science can be an exciting, invigorating field, and for the business leader, it can bring about revolutionary changes to an organisation that can come with huge returns on investment and value added. For the data scientist, designing and delivering successful projects is rewarding, stimulating and tremendously gratifying. We hope this guide gives you the confidence to understand the risks and approach your project in a sensible way. About us We have each worn many hats: data scientists, project managers, mentors and consultants. We met via the S2DS programme, where we worked together as project mentors. Like many data scientists, we have both come to the field via routes in other disciplines. Jonathan Leslie obtained his PhD in Biology from the University of London, studying blood vessel formation at the Cancer Research UK London Research Institute. After 22 years in biomedical research, he turned to data science and founded a freelance consultancy business. In 2017 he joined Pivigo, where he is now the Director of Data Science. He is passionate about promoting open-source software and routinely volunteers as a mentor in the R-programming and data science communities. Neri Van Otten holds a M.Sc. in Computer Science Engineering from Ghent University where she wrote her thesis on optimising energy usage in electrical vehicles by training online personalised deep neural networks. In her 8 years of professional data science experience, she has worked at start-ups, a hedge fund and as an independent data science consultant helping a wide variety of different companies. Technically, she focuses mainly on optimising/scaling machine learning systems to utilise data in real-time, researching deep learning solutions and building NLP (Natural Language Processing) applications. At the moment, she leads the data science efforts at SourceBreaker, runs her own deep learning start-up Spot Intelligence and mentors (aspiring) data scientists. She is passionate about diversity and education and regularly teaches machine learning. We have designed and executed hundreds of projects using data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), most of which we would consider “successful” (you can read much, much more on the topic of “success” in Chapter 2). We have also made countless mistakes along the way and have done our best to learn from them. Designing projects, ensuring stakeholder buy-in and delivering successful, relevant outcomes is a difficult task, and it doesn’t come naturally to anyone. We hope that you can benefit from the mistakes we have made and the learnings we have acquired in our careers. Acknowledgements We would like to thank several people who have contributed to this work. Without you, this would never have happened. We thank Andras Szabo and Kim Nilsson, who spent many hours carefully reading our drafts and providing invaluable feedback. We would also like to thank Ole Moeller Nilsson, Maryam Qurashi, Mandeep Soor, Jason Muller, Neil Forest and Deepak Mahtani for their many suggestions and useful comments.

["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Data science project challenges 1.2 Data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence 1.3 Our framework 1.4 Organisation of this book", " 1 Introduction The past decade has seen an explosion of technological innovations, perhaps none of which more seismic for both businesses and individuals than the field of data science. Indeed, the ability to apply advanced analytics to business challenges can be exciting, fruitful and fun. With recent advances in computational capabilities and cost-effective data collection and storage solutions, applying data science to business challenges is now within the reach of most business owners. Getting started with data science can be daunting, and for the non-specialist, exactly how to begin a data science journey can be unclear. Just like software engineering projects, data science projects require specific design strategies. Our personal experience designing data science projects in a wide range of industries and sectors has given us an understanding of how to make this journey successful and how to work with stakeholders to identify the most impactful business questions and formulate scientific approaches to answer them. In this book, we share our learnings about sensible approaches to designing data science projects. We offer a framework that we have found to be useful in ensuring successful project outcomes and walk the reader through the process of using this framework for their own data science endeavours. Our goal is to provide a resource that data science practitioners can use in their work and give business leaders an insight into the steps that go into building a data science project from scratch. 1.1 Data science project challenges For data scientists who are new to the field, perhaps the single most challenging aspect of the role is not technical, but rather conceptual: learning how to design a successful data science project. Often this means breaking down a complex business case into concrete objectives and specific questions. In our roles as mentors and project managers, we too-often see data scientists attack an analysis without first identifying the underlying questions. These can be specific questions about the scientific approach – “What is the hypothesis of this experiment?” or “What statistical question am I asking my model to answer?” – to more general ones such as, “Why are we doing this?”, “What is an ideal outcome?”, “What would constitute a failure?” or “What is the business problem we are trying to solve?” As we tell our mentees, this approach is like building a house without a blueprint: you might hammer together some bits of wood in a useful way, but without understanding the objectives of the project as a whole, success is essentially impossible. Project design is difficult: it can be loosely structured and often has no single correct answer. This can often be disorienting. How best to approach this task has been considered and discussed often, and many learnings have been derived from the methodologies found in fields such as product design or design engineering. For an excellent discussion of this topic, we recommend episodes 63 - 70 of the podcast Not So Standard Deviations, in which hosts Roger Peng and Hilary Parker discuss the Nigel Cross book Design Thinking and draw parallels to applications in data science. We often think of data science as a process by which we frame a business problem as a scientific question and apply scientific methodologies to answer that question and derive insights. But how do we identify the business question in the first place? As a data scientist, a good first step is to ask different stakeholders. Yet in our experience, this can often be an unsatisfying approach: more often than not, the stakeholders (clients or managers) will not have a clearly-defined business problem or a concrete objective for the project. We believe our framework can help drive this conversation, setting the stage for well-planned project design and giving projects the best chances for success. 1.2 Data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence “Data science”, “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence” are terms that can be used in imprecise ways and can have overlapping meanings. Many will be familiar with the phenomenon of a job advertisement that is billed as a data scientist role but in reality, is more of a data analyst or an IT specialist. AI is perhaps the most liberally-used of the terms, sure to increase one’s chances of writing a successful grant application or tender for a piece of work. It is safe to say that all of these terms can be susceptible to over-hype, and the choice of which to use often appears as a matter of marketing. But there are differences between them and it’s important to understand what those differences are. One of our favourite discussions about how these terms relate to one another comes from David Robinson: Data science produces insights Machine learning produces predictions Artificial intelligence produces actions To expand on this slightly, the goal of data science work is to gain insights and understanding into data. While the numerical patterns revealed may be clear and objective, the way these findings are interpreted requires a human in the loop. One way it differs from machine learning is that data science doesn’t necessarily involve modelling. We would also argue that it doesn’t necessarily involve coding or programming: there are plenty of data scientists that combine domain expertise with statistical inference using spreadsheets to acquire valuable insight. Machine learning extends data analytics into the realm of predictive modelling. This can be done in a highly automated way, although no machine learning system should be allowed to impact decision-making without a human in the loop. Machine learning models can range in complexity and interpretability. For example, linear regression is at the straight-forward end of the spectrum, so much so that many do not consider it machine learning at all. Deep learning models reside at the opposite end of the spectrum, with inner workings that are so opaque that it is essentially impossible to understand how the model makes its predictions. The difference between data science and machine learning is not black and white but rather a spectrum of two overlapping domains. Figure 1.1: xkcd.com Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence is the most common term that is most widely understood but is possibly also the hardest to distinguish between. Everyone will have their view on this but to distinguish it from the other two terms we will define artificial intelligence as an actional application. This can be anything from robotics used in industries, chatbots providing customer service to game-playing algorithms using reinforcement learning. For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen to use the term “data science” throughout this book as this most accurately represents the type of projects we tackle. In most cases, the reader can substitute the term with “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence” without losing the message of the text. 1.3 Our framework Our framework has two related components: project execution and project evaluation. While the temptation may be to view these in series, we have found that these components are intertwined; each has use on its own, but the framework yields the best results when they are used together. In the following chapters, we outline these components, counterintuitively starting with evaluation and then moving on to execution. Why do we start with evaluation? We have found that thinking about what you want the final successful project to look like can help in planning how to get there. In short, we recommend starting with a zoomed-out view of the project as a whole and the context into which it fits before considering the details of how you might get there. We can think of the analogy of taking a road-trip across the country: a sensible approach is to first think about what you want to get out of the journey and what are the major milestones you want to achieve before determining exactly which roads you will take to get there. This has echoes in Test Driven Development (TDD), a common approach to software development in which one first defines the criteria that the final code should adhere to and creates the corresponding tests before writing the actual code. 1.4 Organisation of this book This book is divided into three main sections. In the Chapter 2 we discuss the four levels of project evaluation in more detail and provides examples of how to assess each. In Chapters 3 through 11 we explain our suggested approach to project design and delivery, breaking the process down into six major phases. We finish by providing some practical tips: Chapter 12 is primarily aimed at independent contractors/freelancers and covers how to build up a client base and find work and Chapter 13 lists some useful resources for where you can find help in the wider data science community.

["levels.html", "2 What success looks like 2.1 The four levels of project evaluation 2.2 Contextual level 2.3 Business level 2.4 Product level 2.5 Project process level 2.6 Final thoughts", " 2 What success looks like 2.1 The four levels of project evaluation When approaching a data science project, we often look to the end: knowing what a successful outcome would look like is a good way to determine the direction of a project and the steps required to get there. The idea is that if you meet those criteria – if you deliver something that resembles this desired outcome – you have succeeded. However, while faithful production of the agreed-upon deliverables is indeed important, this is often only part of a much larger picture. In early conversations with a stakeholder, you may have agreed upon a certain set of outcomes and deliverables for the project based on the circumstances and understanding at the time. However, circumstances can change. Similarly, simply because you have achieved a predetermined goal for a project does not necessarily mean that this goal is the best outcome for the business. Part of our jobs as data scientists, especially if tasked with designing a project, is to understand what the business needs and help stakeholders see what is the most beneficial. Thus, simply focusing on deliverables falls short when assessing how successful a project has been. Moreover, often in a data science project, we make unexpected discoveries. If we view these solely through the lens of agreed project objectives they could be considered mistakes or shortcomings, however, the unexpected outcomes are often the most valuable to the business. Eskander Howsawi and colleagues have proposed a framework for evaluating project success that has four levels, termed “context”, “business”, “product” and “project process” (Howsawi et al. (2014); Figure 2.1). In our approach to data science project design, we have found striking parallels to the Howsawi framework. (For a more detailed explanation of these levels and this framework, we recommend reading the paper.) Figure 2.1: The four levels of project evaluation. We evaluate project outcomes at four levels: project process (relating to the execution of the project), product (relating to the delivered final product), business (related to what value the project brings to the business) and contextual (related to circumstances surrounding the project). The higher levels (contextual, business) are more abstract, but also have more relevance to the business value of the work. We recommend you consider all of these when defining, and evaluating, a project. (Adapted from Eskander Howsawi and colleagues.) In the sections below we discuss each of these levels in detail. If you are involved with defining and scoping a project, we strongly recommend you think carefully about how your proposed work satisfies each of these levels. As a consultant, this will be an important part of your role and an important step in developing a project that has real value to its stakeholders. Even if your specific role does not involve project design, we recommend you take the time to consider these levels at both the beginning and the end of a project: if nothing else, it’s a good thought exercise that will be important if you are ever involved in project design. 2.2 Contextual level The first and highest level of the project evaluation framework is termed contextual and is the most abstract. This relates to the circumstances surrounding a project and the externalities that affect it. While considering this may seem beyond the remit of the data scientist’s role, this level is arguably the most impactful: if a project delivers business value, but the circumstances upon which that value is based change, the realised value may change dramatically. Consider, for example, how Brexit may affect UK businesses – project outcomes that may have been valuable in 2016 may not hold up after the UK leaves the European Union. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has had seismic effects on many businesses, changing how they operate and the landscape of business opportunities before them. Projects aimed at pre-COVID business cases may no longer have contextual relevance. Understanding and adjusting for these changing circumstances helps ensure that your work is topical, relevant and impactful. Contextual considerations often are related to business strategy, a good understanding of which is key when designing a project that is going to have an impact well into the future. A company’s business strategy describes its vision, culture and image. At its core is an understanding of the business’s goals and how its leaders intend to achieve those goals. Naturally, business goals are often centred around performance: attracting customers, increasing profits and reducing costs are almost always major driving forces. But the strategy can also extend beyond that to include things such as organisational culture, brand and image and the company’s place in the wider community. It is important to note that the underlying goals driving strategy can vary across sectors. For example, the goals of a government agency will surely be very different from those of private-sector or not-for-profit organisations. Understanding an organisation’s strategy will help you to more clearly see how a data science project fits in. Often such projects are part of an overall move towards innovation, so it can be helpful to clarify what the business is hoping to achieve with that initiative. In our experience, we generally turn to several key questions that can help paint a picture of what the business strategy is: What are your business drivers and your strategic imperatives? What are the main pain points or challenges in delivering your strategy? Who are your competitors and what do you think you need to do to stay or get ahead of them? Where do you think you may be missing opportunities? Do you have any particular business objectives in mind, such as increasing revenue, reducing costs or improving your products or services? Do you have any ongoing data science work already? What is its focus, and how does the current project fit into it? These questions are ones that we, ourselves, often use to help understand the context of the project. They are gleaned from several existing frameworks that can help you to identify the business strategy. We have highlighted a few below. 2.2.1 SWOT analysis SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis is a simple, yet powerful tool that is often used to develop a business strategy. While your job as a data scientist or a consultant is not to define your client’s overall business strategy, the exercise of going through a SWOT analysis can help you to understand how the company views its position in the market. In short, this analysis allows you to identify internal capabilities (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats) to understand the business’s competitive advantage and the factors that are favourable or unfavourable to achieving its objectives. LivePlan has an excellent blog post that provides an overview of the process along with an example and questions to help drive the conversation. 2.2.2 Porter’s Five Forces Porter’s Five Forces framework has echoes in the SWOT analysis described above. Indeed, it’s originator, Micheal E. Porter, developed it in reaction to SWOT analysis, which he felt fell short in analyzing competition of a business. It is generally used to assess an industry in terms of its potential for profitability. While this framework can be a powerful tool, in our experience it is less useful in identifying the contextual environment of how data science, or technical innovation in general, fits into a business’s strategy. Nevertheless, we mention it here for the benefit of those readers who would like to learn more. 2.2.3 PESTEL Analysis PESTEL analysis is used to understand the external forces that an organisation faces. The acronym stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal. The premise is that organisations that are more tuned-in to the changes in these forces will be better positioned to compete. It is often used in conjunction with a SWOT analysis and, when used well, allows an organisation to not only identify these relevant forces but also to assess the potential impact that they may have. These tools can help give you a better understanding of the circumstances and business motivations driving an organisation’s decision to embark on a data science project. You don’t necessarily have to go through the formality of a consultation session or a workshop with your client to understand a project’s wider context, but our very strong advice is to at least go through the exercise of considering some of the questions we have provided. It will give you a better understanding of how your work fits into the business as a whole and will demonstrate to your client that you are willing to take the time to fully understand the forces that drive their decisions. Usually, your client is looking to you to guide them on their data science journey, and knowing the larger context of your work will go a long way to ensuring that the outcome is relevant and valuable. 2.3 Business level The second level of the framework corresponds to the business. In short, this describes how much value the project brings to the business. Unlike concrete, tangible deliverables, business value can be hard to measure. Success on this level may not be realised immediately, but rather may only be understood well after the project has been completed. How does one plan for business-level success when designing a project? This is a complicated question with no single right answer, however, this is often where the creative beauty of project design comes into play. To do this well, you will want to engage with stakeholders to identify opportunities for business value based on an understanding of the organisation’s strategy, therefore the identification of business-level goals should be thought of as a collaborative effort between the data scientist and the business partner. Naturally, projects must be feasible to generate business value. Thus when defining the business case in Phase 1 (Chapter 3), you will often find yourself moving between high-level discussions about what sorts of outcomes would be useful to the organisation and more concrete discussions about feasibility in terms of objectives, budget, data availability and appetite for risk. We discuss ways to drive this conversation during the stages of project design in Chapter 3. In the best cases, the business value generated from a project can be expressed in concrete terms: increased revenue, time saved or measurable increases in customer satisfaction are a few examples. Exactly how a project’s outcome results in changes to these values are often confounded by other factors. In other words, your data science project will likely be one of many factors that, collectively, affect revenue or costs. Therefore, defining KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that can accurately and quantifiably assess the impact of your work in an isolated environment will help when assessing your project’s value at the business level. We recommend that you work with your client or internal stakeholders to identify the relevant KPIs during the design stages of your project. This is covered in Chapter 5.1 in more detail. For another discussion of how to consider business objective in data science projects, we recommend this piece by Peter Skomoroch and Mike Loukides. Sometimes the business value from a project cannot be measured objectively. Indeed, the value of exploratory and proof-of-concept projects is often in the knowledge generated or insights into the potential for future investments. For example, many of our clients undertake proof-of-concept projects to answer specific questions such as, “Is it worth it for us to invest in hiring a data science team to take this work further?” While it’s hard to place a dollar value on generating a reliable answer to this question, the value is certainly high given the strategic aspirations of the client. One way to assess a project’s value in such cases is to align it to the stakeholder’s OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). OKRs and business goals The OKR framework is a system by which a company aligns priorities across all levels of the organisation. For example, three to five objectives could be set for the organisation as a whole, with multiple concrete, measurable key results attached to each. The idea is that the key results will provide evidence as to what extent the objectives have been met. Each level of the company should go through the process, such that company objectives inform departmental OKRs, which in turn help to define the team and individual OKRs. Thus, everyone in the company can be aligned as to what the business priorities are. Often OKRs are defined and reviewed quarterly. Understanding your client’s OKRs can help you to identify key metrics that may be important for assessing a project’s success. For example, your project may be aimed at improving customer insights. Exactly how you would assess the degree to which your project has succeeded is imprecise, and your idea of success may be very different from your client’s. If framed as an objective in an OKR framework, however, you are forced to define a series of key results – measurable outcomes that you can use to assess how you have met the objective. Key results in this example could be, “Define five features that are associated with increased customer churn”, “Build a model that can accurately identify those customers who churned last year 90% of the time” or “Identify which customer segments are most likely to churn.” If your project achieves these key results, you can feel safe in declaring it a success. In cases where it is a struggle to attach metrics to a project’s outcome, consider less tangible benefits to the work. For example, the fact that your client is undertaking a data science project shows that they are adopting a more data-driven approach to their business; while the project itself may not have a tangible ROI (return on investment), this could allow them to position themselves as a data-driven player in the market. In many cases, this resonates with higher-level stakeholders, such as boards of directors or investors. While it may not seem impactful in terms of concrete outcomes, this could certainly have contextual implications such as those outlined in the preceding section. Similarly, a common problem we encounter with organisations that are new to data science or advanced analytics is siloed teams that rarely interact. For example, a marketing team may have one set of data, the sales team may have another and the IT department may have still another. Your project’s value could be in bringing these disparate datasets together to generate a more clear picture of the organisation’s data landscape. While it’s hard to place a number on the value of this outcome, it is probably hugely important to the client and would be a critical first step in improving customer insights in the example above. Whether thinking in terms of measurable quantities or insight generation, we encourage you to look back at the defined project objectives often and consider whether your work is addressing them. It can be easy to lose sight of the target when immersed in a project – reminding yourself about the project goals can help keep you on track. 2.4 Product level The product level is concerned with the deliverables themselves and whether they meet the technical requirements of the project. In data science, this could include factors such as model performance, the accuracy of predictions across the range of data points or the performance of a data product such as a dashboard or interactive visualisation. It may also correspond to the codebase and reports; these must meet the requirements and expectations of a project’s stakeholders. One of the most frustrating project outcomes is the delivery of a fantastic code base that the rest of the company does not know how to use: while the project may have succeeded on a project process level (discussed below), it may not be useful on a product level. Consider, for example, a project where the final deliverable is a productionised solution, such as a recommendation engine. Naturally, the ability to make accurate recommendations is crucial. This should be evaluated empirically, with a metric such as MAP@K (mean average precision at K). You will want to test it on a subset of actual customers and compare its performance to a benchmark of previously used models using an A/B test. You will also likely want to include functionality that measures MAP@K going forward and integrate a model retraining protocol that will be activated (automatically or manually) when the metric dips below a certain threshold. For the recommendation engine to work efficiently, it will have to be integrated into the larger data infrastructure of the client’s system, so your product will also include the plumbing that connects it. For instance, your recommendation engine could be contained in an API. How that API is built and the structure of data coming in and out of it are important considerations, as is the speed with which the API can communicate with the rest of the system. These are a few examples of the considerations that fall under product-level evaluation. Success at this level also corresponds to more granular aspects of your delivered product, such as the codebase itself and associated documentation. Rarely are products intended to be completely static, rather they need to be updated, modified and looked after. It is possible that you won’t be the person who does this in the future so it is your responsibility as the product designer and creator to ensure that you leave your software in a state that others can work with, including future you. Complicated, cryptic and brittle code will make that difficult. If you take pride in your work (and you should!), leaving your project in a fit state is essential. 2.5 Project process level The lowest level is the project process level, which is focused on the actions taken towards producing deliverables. This can include working on-schedule and within budget. Within the context of data science, this can also pertain to actions related to data analysis: we place activities such as EDA (exploratory data analysis), model selection and statistical analyses at this level. In short, this represents the “hands-on” activities of the data scientist. These processes are often managed through project management methodologies like SCRUM or Kanban. For many data scientists, this is where most of your time and energy is spent. It somewhat describes how you use your tools…your scientific chops. When we think of project process level success, we consider things like the quality of your code, your fluency in coding, your knowledge of existing methodologies and approaches, how well you understand the algorithms that drive your models and how you interpret the outcomes. Naturally, many of these items are things that you must improve upon over time. For example, becoming a skilled coder and developing a deep understanding of modelling approaches are skills that must be practised and honed over years, and few of us ever feel that we don’t have room for improvement. Don’t feel that you have to be a coding expert or that you must know the details of every algorithm in the world to have success at this level, but do understand that for those with less experience, it will take more time to deliver successfully at this level. 2.6 Final thoughts We have described four hierarchical levels of project success: contextual, business, product and project process (Figure 2.1). The reader may notice that the lower levels – product and project process – are more concrete and that, as we move up the hierarchy, the levels increase in abstraction. What should also be clear is that they similarly increase in long-term impact: a project that is successful at the product level but that falls short at the contextual level may run the risk of being ineffective or of limited usefulness to the business. We, therefore, recommend that the data scientists consider the framework for project evaluation in descending order, defining the higher levels of success before the lower levels. As you will see in the next section, this is directly related to the phases of project execution and helps to frame the execution framework proposed below. The reader may also notice some overlap between the levels. For example, we place metrics such as model performance under the product level, but it certainly also has relevance at the business level. Similarly, considering ROI has considerable overlap between the business and contextual levels. This ambiguity reflects the fact that each level is a spectrum, and exactly where the borders lie between them is somewhat arbitrary. Nevertheless, we find it useful to work within the framework of these levels: if, for no other reason, it gives structure and organisation to your approach to project evaluation and design. We have provided a lot of information about evaluating projects, and you might be wondering if thinking about all of this is necessary. We feel that the answer is yes, although exactly how much you think about each level will very-much vary depending on the needs of the engagement and your role. Indeed, we do not expect junior data scientists to sit down with a company’s CEO to hammer out the business’s long-term strategic imperatives. However, understanding how your project fits into those imperatives is important, and it will allow you to deliver a more relevant, valuable project. Moreover, as you mature as a data scientist, it will become increasingly important to think about your work in this way. Thus, we strongly encourage you to take the time to consider these levels whenever you embark on a project and to keep them in mind as you work. At the least, it will be a valuable thought exercise; in all likelihood, it will also be a valuable practise that will be more and more important as you mature in your field. References "],
["phases.html", "3 The phases of a project", " 3 The phases of a project Every project is different and the exact way you approach it may vary. That said, we have found that nearly every project has some aspect of six major phases . We outline these in the chapters that follow and in Figure 3.1 below. While you may find that you do not need to formally demarcate each phase explicitly, we suggest that you go through the process of considering each carefully during the course of your project. Figure 3.1: Six phases of a project. When designing and delivering a project, we find it useful to break the process down into these major phases. As the above diagram shows, we see a natural logic flow to the process, starting with a zoomed-out view that defines the project’s objectives in a business context. Phases 1–3 focus on setting the stage for project definition, allowing you to determine if the prospective undertaking could be a viable project. While this may seem intuitive, we have seen many examples of projects that struggled or failed because the designers did not consider these steps carefully. In other words, it can be tempting to jump into the “hands-on” work of a project (Phase 5 above) without taking the time to go through the early definition phases. Once you have determined that success is possible – that you have a viable project concept – the next steps are to design a project plan and put it into action. We call these Phases 4 and 5, respectively. Phase 6 focuses on wrapping up the project and handing it over to its new owners at the end of your engagement. Again, while this may seem like an obvious way to wrap up a piece of work, we find that it can be useful to go through a checklist of points to consider to ensure that your project’s new owners can use what you’ve created, understand how it works and build on your hard work. We describe these considerations in Chapter 10. "],
["phase-1-the-business-case.html", "4 Phase 1: The business case 4.1 Find the business case 4.2 Define the business case", " 4 Phase 1: The business case 4.1 Find the business case You may find that your client already has a clear idea of possible projects. If that’s the case, then we encourage you to go through each and view them through the lens of the contextual understandings identified above. If your client does not have preconceived ideas about possible projects, then you might want to view this conversation as a brainstorming session. In our experience, the following questions can help to drive the conversation: Do you have any ideas that you would like to consider? If you could improve three aspects of your business, what would they be? Do you have a concrete objective or are you trying to implement a more general innovation in your business? As you drill down into specific project ideas, you should consider the practical aspects of delivering the project. For example, we often ask our clients to describe to us what a successful outcome would be, what would be acceptable and what would be outstanding. These questions can be in terms of concrete modelling metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc) or terms of business value (for instance, to save at least £10,000 in lost annual revenue from customer churn). Asking for concrete examples of outcomes can help you to get a sense of your client’s expectations and will allow you to manage these in advance. You will also want to understand what your client will need in terms of deliverables, by which we mean the tangible thing that is delivered at the end of the project. This could include items such as reports, presentations or a code-base, but often also includes more production-ready solutions such as a fully-functional software package or a deployed model or API. Similarly, it can be useful to assess your client’s appetite for risk by asking questions such as, “If our best model is only correct half the time, would that be acceptable?” 4.2 Define the business case As with any scientific experiment, a critical first step in designing a data science project is to define the question and to formulate a hypothesis. To put it in slightly different terms, it is vital that all parties – including the data scientists and the stakeholders – agree on the project’s scope and goals. While a project brief can help identify important aspects of the work, in our experience the best results come from face-to-face conversations with everyone involved. In other words, do not restrict this conversation to a single person, but rather try to get input from every stakeholder who may be involved in the project. A story about stakeholders With a client Neri once worked with, the main stakeholder turned out to be the CFO (Chief Financial Officer). Although he was in no way involved in the project, he was the one who created the budget required for the work. When asking the other stakeholders about the budget and requirements his name came up repeatedly, so we decided to include him in the next meeting. In that meeting, we discussed the scope and even expanded the scope and budget as we were finally talking to the main stakeholder. If however this interaction had not occurred, the project would have taken a completely different direction. When talking to the the different stakeholders, ask yourself whether a clear vision forms from these conversations and, more importantly, whether the different visions from the different stakeholders are aligned. When they are not aligned, it is your responsibility to align them. Find the middle ground and make compromises between the different parties. There is never going to be an infinite budget so you will always need to compromise somewhere. In a related way, it is important to recognise that different stakeholders will almost always come from different backgrounds and have different preconceptions that can influence the way they perceive business problems and potential solutions. As a consultant, you want to take these different points of view into account, and you may even find that you have to defend your point of view as well. When talking to your stakeholders, do not be shy: understanding what the different stakeholders know and value is essential to forming a plan and ensuring that everyone is “on the same page.” In the end, clients or stakeholders will probably respect you more for insisting on going through the rigours of ensuring alignment of their visions for the project plan. A part of your role may also be to help your client understand the principles of data science. To many non-specialists, the field may seem opaque and mysterious. While you should not view your role as that of a teacher (unless that is a specific ask of the client), it can help to give your counterparts a basic understanding of the principles driving machine learning and data science. In this phase, you should be focusing on the contextual and business levels. As a data scientist, it is your responsibility to make sure you and your teammates have thought carefully about what will bring value to the business and whether or not the candidate project aligns with the business strategy long-term. Fully consider how the business will change over time and what will be needed to keep this new part of the system up to date so that it can remain relevant. Systems are in development constantly, the more you learn about the overall product and future of the product through the roadmap, the more you can use this knowledge to make your part of the system more robust. Is one of the data sources being replaced by a richer data source in future? If so how can you build your system so that this can be easily incorporated in your model when this data arrives and how will your models deal with the inconsistency in your old and new data? Writing a recommendation engine for an e-commerce site can be straightforward but how can your model use the clickstream data that will be collected in the future if you do not have this data now? These scenarios, as well as many others, can lead to technical debt in a data science pipeline. While a comprehensive review of how to minimise technical debt is beyond the scope of this article, we recommend Managing Technical Debt. "],
["phase-2-define-success.html", "5 Phase 2: Define success 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) 5.2 Feasibility Study", " 5 Phase 2: Define success After going through Phase 1, you and your client/manager should have a clear picture of what the main objectives of the project are. Now it’s time to narrow in on some details. In this phase, you will address specific requirements to make sure that you and your client/manager agree on what a successful outcome will look like in concrete terms. As part of defining success, it will be essential to map out the business and identify the various people and departments involved in the project. You may find that each stakeholder has a different picture of what a successful outcome looks like, so you must be sure to address these differences and align them as best you can. Project planning is largely about negotiation, so a part of this phase involves you negotiating with the different parties until you get everybody aligned to the same vision. You should not proceed with the next phases of the project until you have acheived this alignment: if you do, for example by choosing to align to the main stakeholder, you risk creating a rift between the other stakeholders and you and the project. This scenario is never a good way to start a project, and if left unchecked such situations can block your chances of success. If there is a conflict you can’t possibly resolve, take this up with the most senior person so that they can pull rank and force alignment this way. When fleshing out the list of features your product or project will include, It can be useful to make two different lists, one with the must-have requirements and one with the nice-to-haves. You can then move different items between the lists when talking to the different stakeholders. When everybody agrees with the final list, you have an agreement and you can focus on implementing the essential requirements while possibly leaving space for some of the less important requirements. At this point, it is also important to think about the bigger picture: what the end product will look like and how this can be achieved. For example, if the end goal is to have a feature in production, then now is the time to figure out how the deployment process works. Consider questions such as who has access to this process? Do you need to get engineers involved and what does their availability look like? In order to be successful, it is essential to consider how we will measure success. Refer back to Chapter 2 and define success on the four different levels: the project process, product, business and contextual levels. For project and process level success we will need to define a metric that accurately reflects the problem that we are trying to solve. This metric is often tied to a business objective. For instance, if we are automatically classifying incoming emails then success could be defined as a system that classifies 95% of all incoming email correctly. In this case, you should also define ‘correctly’. Here, ‘correct’ would be that the classification algorithm has the same outcome as a skilled employee. The exact number you choose will be a trade-off between accuracy and the budget available or time spent. Most companies will already be working with a way to keep track of and define success for their varying departments, this is often framed as Key Performance Indicators. 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Definition A Key Performance Indicator is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives. Organizations use KPIs at multiple levels to evaluate their success at reaching targets. High-level KPIs may focus on the overall performance of the business, while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as sales, marketing, HR, support and others. KPIs are widely used within organisations to measure business objectives. To find KPIs that are relevant to your project you should be able to answer the following questions: What is your desired outcome? Why does this outcome matter? How are you going to measure progress? How can you influence the outcome? Who is responsible for the business outcome? How will you know you’ve achieved your outcome? How often will you review progress towards the outcome? One way to evaluate the relevance of a performance indicator is to use the SMART criteria. The letters are typically taken to stand for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound. In other words: Is your objective Specific? Can you Measure progress towards that goal? Is the goal realistically Attainable? How Relevant is the goal for your organization? What is the Time-frame for achieving this goal? 5.2 Feasibility Study A feasibility study aims to objectively and rationally uncover the strengths and weaknesses of a project in order to assess the likelihood of its success. In its simplest terms, the two criteria to judge feasibility are cost required and value to be attained. For data science projects we tend to focus on technical, economic, legal, operational and scheduling feasibilities. 5.2.1 Technical Feasibility The technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system. It is an evaluation of the hardware, software and technology required to meet the needs of the proposed system. This assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project. When writing a feasibility report, the following should be taken into consideration: A brief description of the business to assess more possible factors which could affect the study The part of the business being examined The human and economic factor The possible solutions to the problem Methods of producing the solution Detailed project requirements This detailed report should stipulate if a project is technically feasible. There are many reasons why projects aren’t technically feasible and it could be as complex as the requirements aren’t simultaneously achievable or the company does not have the know-how to build and maintain the proposed system even if it is technically possible to do so. 5.2.2 Economic Feasibility An economic feasibility study typically involves a cost/benefits analysis of the project, helping organizations determine the viability, cost, and benefits associated with a project before financial resources are allocated. It also serves as an independent project assessment and enhances project credibility – helping decision-makers determine the positive economic benefits to the organization that the proposed project will provide. 5.2.3 Legal Feasibility The legal feasibility assessment investigates whether any aspect of the proposed project conflicts with legal requirements like zoning laws, data protection acts or social media laws. Let’s say an organization wants to store customer information for the use in a recommendation engine on its e-commerce site. A feasibility study might reveal that the laws governing this data differ depending on where the customer is geographically located. Therefore, simply storing this data isn’t possible and a more in-depth analysis of the law needs to be made. Different data will need to be stored for different customers. This might mean that the recommendation engine isn’t feasible for the organisation right now as this would add extra costs and technical difficulty. 5.2.4 Operational Feasibility The operational feasibility study involves undertaking a study to analyze and determine whether – and how well – the organization’s needs can be met by completing the project. Operational feasibility studies also analyze how a project plan satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development. To ensure success, the desired operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of the design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. System design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early design phases 5.2.5 Scheduling Feasibility The scheduling feasibility assessment is the most important study for the project’s success; after all, a project that is delivered too late to be useful is an automatic failure. In this study, we estimate how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in the given time. Time feasibility is a measure of how reasonable the project timetable is. Given our technical expertise, are the project deadlines reasonable? Some projects are initiated with specific deadlines. It is necessary to determine whether the deadlines are mandatory or desirable. "],
["phase-3-scoping.html", "6 Phase 3: Scoping 6.1 Step 1: Cleaning your data and assessing quality 6.2 Step 2: Testing assumptions 6.3 What you hope to learn from scoping 6.4 Is success possible?", " 6 Phase 3: Scoping The word “scoping” can have different meanings to different people, but at its core it means to assess or investigate something. This phase is indeed an investigation: the goal is to explore the supporting data and test some of your hypotheses and assumptions. Note that the goal of this phase is not to necessarily create a proof-of-concept; this phase usually has no concrete deliverables and is more open-ended. Rather this phase is aimed at understanding the size, structure and complexity of the supporting data and to generate a clearer understanding of the problem and what a solution could look like. Ultimately this phase is aimed at determining whether or not it is possible to deliver a successful project. 6.1 Step 1: Cleaning your data and assessing quality Usually this phase starts with a data exploration, during which you should be asking questions such as: Are the data in a clean and usable format? If not what manual/automated effort would be required to get the data in a usable format? How complex are the transformations required? Once you have the data in a usable format, you should ask standard EDA (exploratory data analysis) questions: What abnormalities does the data set have? What do the distributions look like? What do outliers look like? How are missing values recorded? How many missing values are there? Are there any unusual entries that require explanation? Data access and security Getting access to data can often be a challenge due to security policies that may be in place. This is especially common in financial services, but is certainly not limited to this industry. There are many ways of making data access secure so you may have to work with the data administrators to work out a safe and secure plan that works for them. We have each had to endure inconveniences to access data, such as sitting in data-secure rooms with no internet access, having encrypted laptops sent to us to use for our work or having had to access data via VPNs and cloud-based servers that restricted access based on multi-factor authentication. For some industries, we have even had to go through extensive background checks. There are often quite a few hurdles to jump through when it comes to data security so we recommend discussing this with your client early in order to get these hurdles out of the way. What defines clean data can vary greatly across professions and industries. For some people, hundreds of differently structured excel files that are human-readable would be considered clean data; for many data scientists this would be a nightmare, requiring a substantial investment to merge all of the files for them to be analysed as a coherent whole. Databases or data warehouses, in contrast, tend not to suffer from such problems of data structure. However, even well-structured data can require substantial cleaning. For example the dataset could contain duplicate entries, missing values or inconsistently-recorded measurements, to name but a few potential data cleanliness problems. While exploring and working with a poorly-structured or unclean dataset may be agonising, knowing the state of the data that you will use for the project is critical in order to accurately appreciate the scale of the prospective project. Unexpected data cleaning can take weeks and will invariably cause delays to your project, so this insight will allow you to budget appropriately when creating your project plan. 6.2 Step 2: Testing assumptions The next step is reducing some of the uncertainty and risk by carrying out hypothesis testing. What do we mean by that? In one way, we mean statistical hypothesis testing in the truest sense of the word: formulating null and alternative hypotheses and applying appropriate statistical tests to see how well the evidence supports them. However, we also mean testing more general ideas about the data, usually based on anecdotal evidence or domain experience from those who know the business the best. For example, your client may be confident that sales are highest on Fridays – use that as the basis for an experiment in your EDA and see if the data really do support that notion. Often with such assumptions, the data will indeed confirm what your client knows (or, more accurately, thinks they know) about the data. But sometimes those assumptions are wrong, and you are unable to find support for the assumption in the data you have. It is important to note here that hypothesis tests that fail to support your client’s assumptions do not necessarily mean that those assumptions are false. We emphasised the words “in the data you have” in the preceding paragraph for a reason: your data may not be representative of reality. This touches on a fundamental notion in data science – that data is not the same as ground truth. Data are artifacts and are affected by biases in collection methodology, study design, storage, aggregation and interpretation. In short, the data that comes to you has been affected by the many design choices that were made by others – choices about every step on the journey between the real world and the number you see in front of you. No dataset is ever completely unbiased. For an in-depth discussion of this topic, we strongly recommend this article by Angela Bassa. Does this mean that data science is worthless? Of course not. But it does mean that you should keep in mind that some bias will be baked into every dataset. You job is to identify where biases may lay and account for them in your mission to “reach a factual understanding of truth” (Bassa 2017). In an ideal world, you (the data scientist) would have a say in how data are collected and curated, therefore allowing you to understand what design choices were made. In reality this almost never happens, leaving you to work with data that has been affected by the choices of others. During this phase of the project, you will want to validate some of the foundational assumptions upon which your project will be based. Our advice is to do this as scientifically as possible so that you can maximise your chances of accurately assessing what will be involved to deliver the project objectives. 6.3 What you hope to learn from scoping We recommend that you time-box the scoping phase of your project. Exactly how much time you spend will vary: in some cases a few hours of exploring the data may be sufficient, in others you may want to spend several weeks going through a formal in-depth EDA and data validation activity. Time-boxing allows the team to focus their efforts on the most pressing concerns without starting to implement the entire project. Remember, the goal is not to get started with producing results per se, but rather to reduce risk and explore possible solutions. In software engineering, this is often done in the form of a design sprint. In data science, we can also work in sprints but the process is slightly different as we need to validate a hypothesis – the process is far more scientific. Doing this work beforehand helps us drastically reduce uncertainties and ensures that projects which are unlikely to succeed don’t get started; if we discover there is insufficient or insignificant data to reach the goal then we can pause the analysis in order to collect more suitable data, delaying the project until its goals are achievable. The reader might think that doing this phase is hindering the project – delaying it from really getting started and providing little in the way of tangible outcomes. In our experience, this is untrue: when we scope out a project we can more accurately predict what the outcome will be and what resources are needed to achieve the end goal. This translates into less risk for clients and data scientists alike. Being able to quickly demonstrate progress or build a basic proof-of-concept reassures all stakeholders that the project will be successful. For the data scientist, the lower levels of risk can help us to more-confidently estimate the time required for the remainder of the work, thereby avoiding the temptation to add budget padding to defend against unexpected obstacles. We have personally had a 100% success rate of winning project proposals when we have included this stage as a discrete engagement. The reason is clear – having had time to scope out the project, we could write proposals that were more competitive because they lacked the padding often used to protect against project uncertainty. Using science with models It is essential to note that general engineering projects differ from data science projects. Data science projects need to be scientifically correct and for this, you need to follow a scientific process. It is not enough to make a library call to train a model and assume it will perform a certain way just because you tested a few cases. Models you create need to be robust or you will get large varying results that cannot be explained. Making models robust to outliers is an important step in modelling. So be warned, it is often not enough to have used a machine learning library in the past, rather you should be capable of following a scientific process required to build what is necessary for a data science project to succeed. In this phase, it is also important to start thinking about how you will test your final solution. Can you use TDD (test-driven development)? This strategy requires you to set up extensive test cases now that you will use to validate your final solution later. Doing this will let you think through the problem more clearly and write down what criteria the result will adhere to. 6.4 Is success possible? Recall from Figure 3.1 that after this scoping phase, you should assess whether your prospective project is viable. Now is the time to answer that question based on what you learned from this phase of the project. If you believe that you will be able to plan and deliver a successful project, then you should move on to Phase 4. If you are unsure, or believe you cannot deliver a successful outcome, then you will need to go back to the client to either re-define success (Phase 2) or establish a different business case (Phase 1). This result is not a failure but rather an example of your due diligence arriving at an important finding. While it may not be the outcome you or your client wants, it is essential that you allow the scoping project to fail if need be. At the very least you saved yourself from failing at a larger scale. In this scenario, it is useful to clearly identify the reasons for your misgivings and consider how they may be overcome. For instance, would the collection of more data change your mind? Can the data be enriched with another source? Perhaps the incoming data you have been given suffers from some sort of collection or aggregation bias that you cannot account for? If you can somehow make a good recommendation for how the project can still be successful with a few concrete changes, that would be a very valid outcome. For example, can click-stream data be collected from the website if there are insufficient orders to make decent recommendations for customers who have never bought an item? This would solve the cold start problem many recommendation engines face. If you are happy that your project “has legs”, then it’s time to move on to Phase 4: Project definition. This is where you concretely design the project, including recommended approach, phases, milestones, timelines, resources and budgets. It’s a big stage and a big chapter, and one that will be critical for the success of most project. See you there! References "],
["definition.html", "7 Phase 4: Project definition 7.1 Developing a project plan 7.2 Skills/expertise required 7.3 Determining the cost 7.4 Managing the project 7.5 Evaluate the plan 7.6 Closing thoughts", " 7 Phase 4: Project definition If you have followed the steps outlined in phases 1-3, you will have now determined that the project is viable. You will have confirmed that, in principle, the project makes contextual sense and that it is likely to bring value to your stakeholder, and you are now ready to think in terms of the specifics about how you will deliver the work. Congratulations…this represents a major crossroads for any project, and you should be proud of yourself for having had the discipline to work through Phases 1 – 3 carefully. Now you are ready to start your project in earnest! But hold on! Before you start writing code and delving into the work, you must plan the project – that is what Phase 4 is about. This is the design phase, where you lay out in detail the approach you will take, the steps that will be included and the resources that will be required. We often hear people say things such as, “Data science is research…how can I say how long it will take if I don’t know what I’m going to find?” This is a valid concern – in an ideal world, you would have all the time and money you need. Sadly, this is an example of the difference between the ideal world and reality: if you are working with a client or a manager, you will need to inform that person what will be required in terms of time and money. Can you be absolutely certain that your estimations are sufficient? No. But you can make reasonable estimations with the information you have, and this is where the art of project design comes in. Designing a project plan and timeline accomplishes a few important things. It helps you to organise your thoughts and think in concrete terms about how you can attack the problem at hand. It gives all of youre project’s stakeholders a picture of how the project will evolve and progress and shows them where the important milestones and decision points lie. It also helps the practitioners break the larger body of work into smaller, more manageable tasks. In short, it helps everyone understand the deliverables and the course of action. Your plan does not need to be cast in stone – changing a plan can always be done, but operating without a plan will invariably be slower than operating with one. This phase uses a different type of thinking than is normally found in scientific research, so it can be especially difficult for those data scientists who come from research backgrounds. While research generally uses deductive reasoning (the reasoning of logic) and inductive reasoning (the reasoning of forming general rules from observations), the synthesis required for design thinking uses intuition, or more accurately, abductive reasoning – the reasoning of developing one of several possible solutions for a problem. More specifically it is seeking the simplest solution to a problem without any formal validation. For a more detailed explanation of how designers think, we recommend the book Design Thinking by Nigel Cross. For the purposes of this writing, what is important is to understand that this relates to the process of identifying a set of required functionalities or purposes and crafting a solution that satisfies those purposes. What is abductive reasoning? Abductive reasoning starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks to find the simplest and most likely conclusion from the observations. This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it. Abductive conclusions are thus qualified as having a remnant of uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in terms such as “best available” or “most likely”. For many, project design is difficult, ambiguous, stressful and downright unpleasant. Indeed, this phase requires you to commit to delivering a given bit of work in exchange for a certain budget, and you want to get it right – who wouldn’t find that responsibility stressful? You inherently can’t know exactly what it will take to deliver a successful outcome because that insight only really comes from the work itself. But if you have done a good job of scoping the project in Phases 2 and 3, then you should have a fairly good idea of the complexity of the task in front of you. 7.1 Developing a project plan We suggest you begin by thinking at a high level. Ask yourself questions such as: where are you starting from, where do you want to be when the project is completed, and what are the logical steps you need to take to get there? Consider what functionalities are required, and which ones would be nice to have but are not critical? What are the novel concepts and approaches you will have to develop? Are there logical intermediate steps along the way? Does something depend on something else being completed first? In most cases, we break a project down into stages with aims and milestones. We find it useful to clearly define what work will be carried out in each stage and what will be delivered at the end of it. Sometimes a “deliverable” is merely a short report, a small presentation or a conversation with your client/manager. In other cases, it can be a piece of software or a tangible functionality that can be demonstrated. Exactly what the deliverable at the end of each milestone looks like is project-dependent. In the best cases, each milestone in itself is a valuable step forward for the stakeholder. This de-risks the entire project. For example, a project may be aimed at building an interactive data analytics dashboard with four milestones along the way. Milestone 1 may be an in-depth exploratory analysis that can yield important insights about the data. If their project were to end there, the work would still have brought value. While this is not always possible, we suggest you keep this in mind as something to aim for when crafting your project timeline and stages/milestones. Throughout this process, it can be useful to consider pivot points or alternative outcomes. For example, many projects have milestones that are inherent points for decision-making. If that is the case for your project, be sure to communicate that clearly in your project plan. When making these decisions, try to balance flexibility and open-mindedness with a clear view of business value. In the earlier scoping phases, you will have identified the project requirements in terms of outcomes and deliverables. If these include data products that require engineering or deployment (as opposed to projects primarily focused on the generation of insights and models), you will need to include corresponding milestones for these steps as well. Data cleaning, code refactoring, optimisation and productisation can be time-consuming, as can deployment of your product and the development of sound ETL pipelines – be sure to budget for these in your project plan and think carefully about what a sensible development plan looks like. 7.2 Skills/expertise required As you plan your project, the required technical and non-technical skills should start to become clear. Many of these will be general data science skills, such as coding ability, familiarity with machine learning algorithms or a knowledge of how to make compelling and informative data visualisations. Others are more specialised, such as natural language processing or graph theory. And yet other skills are more niche and therefore harder to come by, such as domain-specific experience. For example, Jon recently worked on a project that required an in-depth knowledge of how the three-dimensional geometry of a material affects the shape of electrical waveforms; most data scientists (including Jon) will not have this particular experience! Ensuring you have the industry-specific experience to deliver the project or make sure that you have willing sponsors within the company who will set aside time to work with you on understanding any industry quirks and nuances. Your approach to meeting the skills required for a project is, of course, dependent upon the composition of your team. If you are designing a project that you will work on individually, then it is up to you to make sure you have the skills required in your repertoire. If you don’t, you may need to consider bringing in outside help or budgeting for the time it will take to level-up your shortfall. Often projects are designed for teams of data scientists, in which case you will want to make sure that the skills required are matched collectively by the team. Data Science, like software development, is often a team sport. “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” – African Proverb 7.3 Determining the cost You will almost certainly have to put a price tag on your project. For us, this is essentially a calculation based on how long we think the project will take and the billing rate for the staff. Often the data scientist bill on a per-day basis based on their experience: “junior”, “mid-level” and “senior” data scientists each have different rates. In our approach we focus on the project duration and the skills required, and then calculate the cost of the project as a whole. For instance, we may decide that a project requires a considerable amount of data wrangling and NLP, and that a team consisting of a junior data scientist (for the data wrangling) and a senior NLP expert for 5 weeks is likely to be a good formula. We would then calculate the project cost based on the day rates of these two individuals. We prefer this method to one in which we try to fit the project duration or staff rates into a pre-determined project budget: it keeps us more honest and shields us from subconscious biases that could cause us to build the delivery around the price, not the other way round. As discussed above, getting the right project cost can be difficult. If your estimate is too low you may not have the time needed to complete the work; if it’s too high, you risk losing the contract. The latter case is especially relevant if you are competing against other providers, for example in the case of a proposal written in response to an RFP (request for proposals). For other projects, the cost factor might not be important: internal project within a company often overrun without any negative consequences. For those to whom the cost factor is important, we don’t have a magic formula that tells how to strike the right middle ground. What we can do is highlight some considerations that we find helpful in the process and offer our reassurance that it gets easier to make this judgment as you become more experienced. Breaking the project into milestones as described above can help: it’s easier to estimate the time required for smaller tasks than for larger ones. Understanding the supporting data will also help, which is a major reason for the scoping work described in Phase 3. This is also a place where having a solid network to turn to for advice might be very useful. At Pivigo, for example, our data team discusses each project plan that is being written to get as many different points of view as possible. If you have access to a network of peers, going through such a sense-check can be a very valuable process. Experience is key, so it may be useful to look at different case studies or to ask colleagues about similar projects and how long they took. It can also help to anticipate places where the work is at a higher risk for delays. For example, you may have made assumptions about the data structure based on your scoping work, only to find out that some of these assumptions are not correct. The data coming in may have changed in structure or location, or unanticipated factors may have worked to introduce more missing values than you expected. You can’t anticipate every possible roadblock, but if you can identify places where your progress is most vulnerable to problems, you can make a conservative estimate. We also encourage you to consider the state of your relationship with your client when budgeting for a project. Have you worked with this company or person before? If you have, and if the project was successful, you probably have earned a degree of trust that can go a long way in convincing them that your proposal is reasonable. In contrast, if the business is new to data science, or new to you, you have yet to earn their trust and may want to be more cautious in how you cost your project. Similarly, if you feel that your client/manager has the potential for being demanding and hard to please, it may be a good idea to err on the side of caution by budgeting a bit generously. In these cases, the costs of underestimating the required time are high. On the other hand, if the project is exploratory, if your client/manager is just looking to see the “art of the possible” or if your project is restricted to creating insights, you may feel a bit braver and choose a slightly lower budget: the costs of underestimating the time required are lower. Or, to think of it in another way, even if you only accomplish 95% of what you would have liked, that is still very valuable for the business. The table below highlights some of benefits and risks to over-budgeting or under-budgeting your project. Pricing Potential_benefits Risks Under-budgeting Your proposal may be more attractive to the stakeholders. The potential to show your client/manager good value-for-money Get a “foot in the door”/opportunity to prove yourself Your client/manager may be skeptical that you can deliver You may not be able to deliver You are vulnerable to expected problems Setting the expectation too low for the follow-on work (assuming you get it) Over-budgeting Extra time padding can give you a greater chance of success Greater chance of overdelivering and delighting the client/manager Greater chance of more work, due to happy client/manager Your price may be too high/losing the work It can also be useful to think about aspects of the project that are “must-haves” versus those that are “nice-to-haves”. At the very least, your budget should give you enough time to safely deliver the must-haves. Taking a slightly more risky approach to the nice-to-haves may be more aligned with your client’s or manager’s appetite. This is especially true if your client/manager is on a tight budget. In such cases, an approach we often take is to write a proposal with several costs: a cost for the essential (must-have) work and additional add-on costs for the nice-to-have bits. We find this resonates with clients/managers who are nervous about spending a lot of money on a project that has yet to show good ROI (return-on-investment). We also recommend treating your proposal as a step in a back-and-forth conversation with the client/manager: invite the client/manager to comment on the content and the plan, and be open to the possibility of changing the plan if the client/manager is not comfortable with the initial version. While you may not be willing to make sacrifices in your rate (and generally you should not be), you can adjust the scope of the project to better align with your client’s/manager’s needs, wishes, concerns and budget. This will not only help you to find the right balance for your client/manager, but it will also help to build trust by showing that you are trying to work with them to produce something that is useful and has good value-for-money. We also encourage you to mention any other costs that the client/manager may incur. For instance, if your work requires the use of a virtual machine or the creation of a database that will be hosted on the cloud, these are costs that the client/manager will want to know about. Hosting your solution can also bring with it security concerns and other maintenance costs or complications. Be sure to be as thorough as possible when breaking down the costs to your client. This will help them to understand the total expense of the project. It will also help in your efforts to build up a trusting relationship with them. Or, to put it another way, surprising your client/manager with unexpected expenses can undermine the trust that you are striving to build. In short, our advice is to view your work with your project stakeholders as a relationship that has to be built and nurtured, and do your best to approach it with empathy for all the people who are involved. 7.4 Managing the project At this point, you have a project plan and you have accounted for the technical skills that will be needed to bring it to fruition. However, a final consideration is still outstanding: how will you manage the project? As above, if you are working on a project independently, then this is probably a fairly easy question to answer. If you are designing the project for a team, then planning for the project’s management will be critically important. Either way, we suggest that you take some time to consider exactly how you will work and how you will interact with your client. Project management is a large field – we cannot give it justice in this small section. When done well, a project flows smoothly and has a clear road-map and an efficient system for sharing the workload. Everyone is happy with the work and they all feel like they are contributing towards a common goal. When done poorly or not at all, a project can stagnate and become aimless, deadlines are frequently missed and the project outcomes may not align with the project goals. Good project management cannot turn every project into a masterpiece, but it can go a long way in keeping a project on-track, focused and successful. For some teams, a scrum approach can be useful, although you should bear in mind that this is designed for software development and there do exist significant differences between this field and data science. In our work, we tend to adopt an agile methodology (Scrum or Kanban), in which we work in discrete sprints and organise our tasks in the form of concrete issues. Other approaches also exist, such as the more traditional waterfall model. Tools such as Kanban boards and Gantt charts can be very helpful in planning out your project and breaking down the major phases of the project into tangible, bite-sized pieces. Even if you are a team of one, we have found that the formality of organising work in this way can be very helpful in keeping the focus on project priorities. In addition to planning out how you will work and communicate with your team, you should also make a plan for how you will interact with your client/manager. You should consider how you will communicate on a day-to-day basis (we have found Slack to be very useful) as well as how and when you will give progress reports and project updates. We also encourage you to think about how you intend to structure your codebase. We generally use Git and GitHub for version control and code sharing, and we would encourage you to build your repository’s directory structure before any code is added. We highly recommend the “cookiecutter” family of project templates and have found the Python-based data science template to be a good fit for most of our Python-based projects. It includes a guide to best practices for directory structure and naming conventions and contains a built-in make functionality that can be useful for managing the steps required to build the requisite datasets and functions for your project. For R-based projects, one option is the ProjectTemplate, although others also exist. At the minimum, we encourage you to work within the framework of an R Project. 7.5 Evaluate the plan If you have followed the steps above, you will now have defined your project. You will have a project plan that includes milestones, a timeline, potential pivot points and clearly-defined deliverables. You will have determined the composition of the team needed to execute the project and have thought about how the team will work together and liaise with the client/manager. You will have also created a budget for the project based on the time required, cost of staff and any other costs required. You probably can’t wait to send your proposed plan off to the client/manager and get to work! But before you do, we encourage you to look back at the four levels of project evaluation outlined previously. Think about the business case and the larger context of the project in relation to the business strategy, and ask yourself if what you have planned will be valuable to the client. If you are not convinced that it will be, you may need to reconsider your plan. As a parting piece of advice, we suggest that you take the time to make a short list of ways that the project is likely to bring value and to add a sentence or two to your proposal highlighting this. While it may seem obvious to you, and you may feel that it should be obvious to the client/manager, it can help to remind them about why your project will have a positive impact for their business and reassure them that this proposal is a worthwhile investment. Bear in mind that if your client is a company, the person you have been liaising with may not be the final decision-maker or the one who controls the money. The proposal you write may be passed on to executives in the company who you have never met and who don’t have any understanding of the project. Explicitly explaining why your proposed project is likely to bring value to them on both the business and contextual levels will make it easier for that person to say “yes”. 7.6 Closing thoughts Designing a project plan can be hard work, but we strongly encourage you to take the time to do it well. Many early-career data scientist struggle with the fact that the process may be loosely defined. This can be a struggle for anyone – sitting down at a blank sheet of virtual paper and figuring out what to say is not easy. To help get you started, we have included an example project proposal in the next chapter, showing one way we might structure our proposals and project plans. We hope it helps get you started! "],
["example.html", "8 Example project plan", " 8 Example project plan Your authors have designed, managed or delivered hundreds of projects. Despite that experience, the process can still be uncomfortable and disorienting. This is especially true for Phase 4 (Chapter 7), in which you have to create concrete details about your execution plan. Many find this especially daunting: it’s a subjective endeavour with no right answers – what might be best for one project may be well off-the-mark for another. We felt it would be valuable, then, to show an example of how we might present a project plan in the form of a written proposal. The example below is based on a real proposal we wrote. It is, by no means, the only way this project could have been designed, nor is it clear that this was the best way. It was simply the way we approached the task. We hope the example is useful to you. Proposal for Client X Introduction: Client X specialises in creating high-performance, affordable exercise gear for serious and recreational runners alike. Their vision is to create an online shopping experience for their customers, in which they can shop for shoes, apparel and accessories without having to walk into a store. However, this vision comes with understandable obstacles, such as how to convince customers that an online shopping experience can match the experience they would expect in-store, which has the benefit of allowing a customer to try on several sizes and models. Furthermore, many customers have reported that working with a sales associate directly gives them more confidence that the suggestions brought before them are personalised in a way that an online shopping experience cannot match. Client X would like to dispel this rumour by making the Client X online shopping experience more personalised. In this proposal, we outline a project in which we will develop a personalised recommendation engine for Client X, which will employ innovative approaches to understanding Client X customers. Project description: In this proposal, we outline a project aimed at helping Client X create a more personalised customer experience. We will focus on two main objectives: (1) an analysis of customer segments and (2) the development of a recommendation engine. We feel that these two branches of the project will combine to give Client X a better understanding of their customers’ tastes and preferences and will allow them to deliver a more personalised customer experience. In Objective 1, “Customer Insights”, we will perform a customer segmentation analysis on data from Client X’s CRM (Customer Relationship Management), sales and marketing systems. We will first perform an in-depth analysis of the Client X data in which we will assess data quality and completeness and perform preliminary exploratory analyses, looking for clear relationships between the features available. We will then, in conjunction with Client X staff, select a subset of features that we feel have the most utility for separating customers into meaningful, interpretable segments. To achieve this we will take an unsupervised approach, exploring several clustering methodologies before determining which we feel has the most promise for this particular dataset. When performing cluster analysis, an important consideration is in determining the optimal number of clusters. While techniques such as the elbow method can be useful in arriving at this number, we feel it will also be important to sense-check the outcome with Client X stakeholders who understand their customers the best. Thus, throughout this project, we will have regular progress updates with Client X to show our findings and illustrate descriptive analyses of how the resultant clusters differ from one another. In Objective 2, “Product recommendations”, we will focus on building a recommender system that can be used to suggest products to Client X customers. We plan to use collaborative filtering in combination with the customer segments identified in Objective 1, however we may find through the course of researching this project that a different approach is more appropriate. We have, therefore, broken this project into two discrete phases: research and building. The research phase will explore various recommender system approaches intending to gain enough knowledge to choose a single best option for the build phase, in which we will productionise an engine that runs on the Client X Google Cloud Platform instance, ingesting data from the Client X datastores and returning the outcome via an API. We will work with the Client X engineering team to ensure that the API produced returns information in a format that can be processed by the rest of the Client X data infrastructure. We outline the plan for this project below. Project Proposal: Customer Insights and Recommendations Objective: This project is aimed at developing a personalised recommendation engine that will employ innovative approaches to understanding Client X customers.

["execution.html", "9 Phase 5: Exploration, execution and pivots 9.1 Research 9.2 Prototyping 9.3 Build, assess, rinse and repeat 9.4 Evaluate 9.5 Go to client 9.6 Summary", " 9 Phase 5: Exploration, execution and pivots At this point, you have done your homework. You have explored the project’s feasibility, you have scoped the work and you have put together a project plan that resonates with the project owner, usually a client (for contract work) or a manager (for internal projects). (For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to this person as the “client” throughout this chapter.) You have determined that the proposed work makes sense in terms of feasibility and business value to your stakeholders, and you have decided that it passes muster in a larger, contextual sense. You have prepared, worked hard and thought about what lies ahead of you. It’s time to start with the implementation phase! However, the fact that the project has begun does not mean that you have no more questions nor need to tap into the knowledge of subject matter experts. It is, therefore, essential that the stakeholders involved in the project remain available for question-and-answer sessions. Questions will range from data clarification to issues around industry knowledge and how the end-user will be using the product. The more the stakeholders remain involved, the more input they will have along the way and the happier they will be with the result. We recommend scheduling time slots that together accumulate to a minimum of 0.5 days a week for clarifying meetings. At this point, we would like to address a common misconception: that developers and data scientists need to have domain expertise to solve domain-specific problems. While we do find that familiarity with a specific industry can certainly help a data science project get started, we have rarely seen that industry knowledge is essential. We would further argue that a lack of domain expertise can be a positive thing – it allows one to view a problem in a way that is unencumbered by prior assumptions and biases. Naturally, anyone working in a new field will have a lot to learn and may get off to a slow start. Digital marketing, for instance, has a nuanced vernacular, with terms such as “reach”, “engagement” and “conversion” meaning very specific things in specific contexts. But in our experience, as long as subject matter experts are available to help answer questions, prior industry knowledge is not essential. In thinking about our projects and how we have worked, we generally have four main stages to project execution: research, prototyping, building and evaluation. Naturally, every project is different and has different needs, but rarely have our projects not at least touched on each. The movement between them is not always linear or ordered and your project may not smoothly flow through these stages, but we find it useful to think in terms of how your work fits in to these stages. As a rule of thumb, we normally spend 25% of our time researching, 25% on prototyping and the remaining 50% of our time iterating between building and evaluating (which tend to go hand-in-hand). However, it should be noted that some projects are, by definition, experimental with a POC as the objective. In such projects, research and prototyping carry a bit more weight. However, in most cases, these projects do require substantial documentation, reporting and knowledge transfer (which we discuss in Chapter 10, Phase 6). Thus, the amount of time you spend on developing your POC may increase at the expense of building an optimised solution, but you should leave plenty of time to wrap up your work. Often this is more time-consuming than building a solution, and you should budget your time accordingly. During the early stages of this phase, you will likely be focusing on two questions: “Is the goal of the project possible?” and “How should I get to it?” These loosely correspond to the research and prototyping stages of a project, respectively. The outcome of this work can be thought of as a “proof-of-concept” (POC). Naturally, these questions are related: you can’t predict that a goal is possible without having some idea of how to get there. Often you have several possible approaches to choose from; your aim should be to identify the best of those possibilities, test it on your data and determine if it is, indeed, a sensible approach to build and develop further. Similarly, building and evaluation often go hand-in-hand, as we discuss in more detail below. At the end of this chapter we have included a section entitled “Go to client”, which is less of a stage and more of a call for frequent check-ins throughout the course of the engagement. 9.1 Research Nearly every project includes periods of research, focused on taking an in-depth look into the problem at hand. This includes considering different ways to frame the question and weighing the potential approaches to answer it. Almost always this will include a visit to your favourite search-engine. Many data scientists will also have a library of resources they can turn to, which could include books, blogs, articles, colleagues, mentors or even tweets. We recommend that you build your own such library of favourite resources, and organise them in a way that makes intuitive sense to you and that you can quickly access when needed. For example, we make heavy use of bookmarks on our favourite browser, being sure to organise them by topic and update them from time to time. We all learn in different ways, but you should bear in mind that talking to an expert is often the most efficient manner to get information; the time you save can be put towards other activities that could add value to the project. Naturally, you will need to have a network of people you can turn to, and this is not something that can be built quickly. Your network of colleagues will likely be one of your most valuable assets, and you should not underestimate how important it is to build, nurture and contribute to it. Please see Chapter 13 and the Build a network Section of Chapter 12 for advice on how to build your professional network. While gathering information from experts can go a long way towards understanding the task at hand, it is important to do your research as well. Unless you are very knowledgeable, you may have to do some homework to find out how industry leaders solve similar problems to those that you are facing. While you may not need to use the state-of-the-art technology (and very often you won’t), it is good to know what benefits the most cutting-edge technologies offer, as well as what costs they incur. Indeed, every solution will have pros and cons and it is your task to make an informed decision. The time you spend researching will translate into substantial improvements in efficiency. Consider whether you can find research papers describing or comparing similar approaches and if software packages already exist with basic implementations of the algorithms you need. Utilising what is available lets you invest your time in creating something new and maybe even allows you to give back to the community. For instance, you may end up extending someone else’s open-source software. If so, this can be a good opportunity to contribute a pull/merge request – most developers welcome suggestions (however you should look for contributing guides before creating one). Did you end up comparing different techniques? Publish a paper or blog about it. Others will appreciate the information and you will get your name out into the wider community. Getting up to speed in a domain that is unfamiliar can be slow and, at times, little overwhelming. Often the work requires a fairly comprehensive understanding of the field or potential scientific approaches before we can build a solution. While this may seem daunting, you should remember that when you are new to a data science project, you have a window of time in which you’re allowed to be ignorant. In other words, it’s acceptable to not know the field because you’re new to it. That empowers you to ask questions, even ones that you worry may be “stupid”. This window of opportunity will not be open forever, so use it when you’re starting and don’t be self-conscious about it! When immersing yourself in a new field, it is good to be aware of biases and industry knowledge that may be accepted as general knowledge but that you may lack. A good example of this is the financial sector and the stock market. When predicting stock prices, most people are aware that they need to do backtesting to test for statistical significance. Without any further financial knowledge, you might simply think that when your model has significant predictive power you will likely make money on the stock market. Many amateur algorithmic traders have found out from experience that reality is not that simple – they lacked the financial knowledge to see the pitfalls in their analysis and so their algorithms failed due to a lack of information. 9.2 Prototyping Once you have researched possible approaches to your project’s goal it’s time to choose the best candidate and see if it will work. This is the goal of prototyping. You may have found through your research that there is a single, clear best path. In that case, you may be able to quickly create a minimal prototype and move on to building directly. In other cases the situation is more uncertain; you will have to test the possible approaches empirically on your data to make an informed decision about which seems the best based on the evidence you gather. In either case, we recommend building at least a very simple prototype for your project so that you can be confident that what you are going to build out in the next stage is, in fact, a viable solution. Once you have chosen an approach that you believe will work, you can move on to the building stage. (However, before doing so, it’s a good idea to check in with your client, as we discuss below.) On the other hand, your prototyping efforts may give you unwelcome news. For example, you may find that your top choice candidate approach does not do well with your data. In this case, we’re afraid you will have to start the research again, re-evaluating if you still think that the result is possible and exploring another candidate approach for prototyping. This is frustrating but important – research can be slow and you may have to be patient. We all want to start building a solution, but building the wrong solution will be costly! Be sure to use your research time wisely so that you gather accurate, reliable information and make well-informed decisions. By the end of this stage, you should have decided on a course of action, selected the algorithms you intend to use, demonstrated that the chosen solution is going to work and started iterating on putting it together into a coherent product. As a general guide, you should be about half-way through the hands-on phase of the project. If you don’t have a working prototype by this point, it’s time to think carefully about whether you will be able to deliver the expected outcome. The need to discuss the state of the project is especially important in this situation: while it may not be a conversation you want to have, waiting to communicate the state of a project that may be in trouble will usually make the situation worse, not better. 9.3 Build, assess, rinse and repeat For many data scientists (your authors included) the building stage is where the fun happens. Here you focus on developing your prototype further to create a product that meets – and sometimes exceeds – your project’s objectives. The objective could be anything from a great model that runs locally, to a full-fledged solution that scales in production. If you have entered this phase with a respectable prototype, you will most likely start the build by trying to improve upon your results. Often this comes down to expanding your dataset and using scientific creativity to devise new ways of using it. Correspondingly, feature engineering is often a big part of the building process. If you have identified shortcomings in the data you started with, you may want to look for ways to bring in other data. Sometimes this involves external datasets that are publicly available. For example, the Index of Multiple Deprivation can be a very useful dataset to include in your analysis when trying to find relationships between UK geography and a pattern in human behaviour. Building is iterative by nature. As you build, you will trying to make improvements to you models and data pipelines. This process is, by nature, experimental – some changes you make will result in improvements, and some will not. Similarly, some improvements will come at a cost that is prohibitive to the final product. For example, a model that uses a deep neural network may give you a 5% improvement to model performance than over a logic regression model, but it may come at the expense of speed or interpretability. You will likely have to make strategic choices throughout, and we encourage you, where possible, to include your client in these decisions (see Go to client below). This iterative approach applies not only to the methodology underpinning the analysis, but also to the code that underlies it. A good example of this is in code optimisation: we all want fast code, but trying to get the code logic working while simultaneously optimising the code can be difficult. Our advice is to get it working first, then worry about making it fast and robust. Often framing your coding work in the context of building a software package or library can help: the process of building a package/library inherently forces you to write better code that is more robust and efficient. Similarly, testing your code rigorously will force it to be better and less brittle. As you are building and testing the output, you will undoubtedly explore various possible methods and assess their strengths and weaknesses as you refine the work. But how should you make these comparisons – what should you take into account when deciding on how to proceed? Assessment is a key part of this stage that can help ensure that you are making wise choices. When many non-specialists think of assessment the word “accuracy” comes to mind. Experienced data scientists often avoid this term as it means something very specific and is seldom a meaningful metric to evaluate model performance. You should consider other metrics such as precision, recall or F1 score. However, assessment extends far beyond model performance; many factors will dictate what the right choice is for your project. For example, you may need a highly interpretable model, or you may need something fast. Exactly what is important for your project can vary, and you should keep this in mind throughout this phase. How you assess your work should not be an afterthought – on the contrary, you should think about how you intend to measure performance from the outset. Having a meaningful way to assess your work will also be important for benchmarking. Benchmarks are a handy way to set a standard against which you can compare your model’s performance. We encourage you to set benchmarks early in your project and set aside time to develop these benchmarks. Knowing what the previous standard was can give you a demonstrable way to show added value from your work. Your final results should always be quantifiable, so set yourself up for success by defining your KPIs and measure your final success against them. Understanding what’s going on inside your model A common notion is that artificial intelligence is complicated and cannot be understood. It is often treated as a black box with a magical outcome. Developers who use machine learning libraries without fully understanding them often create or support this misconception. This viewpoint, however, originates from a lack of knowledge. Most machine learning libraries are open source and a skilled data scientist will be able to dig into their models and alter or understand the results it produces. At their core, machine learning models are mathematical models – data is manipulated through a series of mathematical operations. These operations are not random but should be well-chosen to produce favourable results. Understanding this process lets you understand the limitations and the overall behaviour of the model. Once this is properly understood, one can make deliberate changes that improve the model overall, remove bias or simply handle outliers that had been previously neglected. What is open source? Open Source is any computer software that is distributed with its source code available for modification. That means it usually includes a license for programmers to change the software in any way they choose: They can fix bugs, improve functions, or adapt the software to suit their own needs. As a side note, it is important to be conscientious when choosing your machine learning toolkit. If you use closed and proprietary systems like those provided by IBM, Google and Amazon, be aware that you will lose visibility and the ability to understand the system fully. Testing As with software development, data science projects should be rigorously tested to ensure model performance. Create test cases and make sure your model adheres to them. Later if you need to update the model with new data, these test cases should still hold and make any update robust. Testing is somewhat of an art form, and it takes a lot of experience and practice to become good at devising a sensible, rigorous testing scheme. Furthermore, the notion of “unit testing” is not entirely sufficient in data science. Nonetheless, it’s good to have an understanding of testing principles. If you or a colleague has made changes to some code and want to replace the old version, how do you know it has not introduced any problems (let alone that it’s improved)? Unit tests help ensure this for software, along with code reviews. For data science work, we have found it useful to recruit reviewers to inspect results from experiments. Another common use case for unit testing in software is to ensure things work properly before automatic deployment to a production environment. For machine learning models in a production environment, you can run code that retrains your model on new data automatically and redeploys your updated model to production. In this situation, you may want the deployment to fail if your updated model fails to meet certain conditions. To handle this, abort the deployment if your retraining script throws an error. This allows you to build any gatekeeping checks you wish while ensuring consistent quality. A note on notes Any experienced researcher will know that a critical part of the work lies in keeping detailed records. This is no different for the data scientist – keeping track of results, as well as detailed records of assumptions and choices that you make, is essential. Aside from the fact that this is scientific best-practice, it also makes practical sense: it is not uncommon to examine your final results and realise that something doesn’t make intuitive sense. In this case, you will have to do some detective work to figure out why. Good notes that include information about the assumptions and potential errors you made along the way will make that task a lot easier. In a recent episode of one of our favourite podcasts, Not So Standard Deviations, host Roger Peng and guest Jenna Krall discussed the topic of how assumptions and undocumented workflows can impact data science research. If you are interested in learning more about this topic, than Project TIER is a great place to start. While saying that you should take good notes may seem obvious in principle, it is very easy to fall short in practice. Data science projects can move fast, and we all get caught up in the excitement of discovery or writing code that works well. It’s good to be excited – the work is exciting – but don’t let yourself forget to be a good scientist in the process. 9.4 Evaluate As you are building, it’s a good idea to keep in mind the four levels of project evaluation we outlined in Chapter 2. Recall that we described them as such: The process level is focused on the actions taken towards producing deliverables. The product level is concerned with the deliverables themselves and whether they meet the technical requirements of the project. The business level describes how well the project brings value to your client. The contextual level is the most abstract and relates to the circumstances surrounding a project and the externalities that affect it. We encourage you to revisit these levels often throughout your project. During the Build stage, you will mostly focus on the process and product levels. But it is also important to not lose sight of the higher business and contextual levels. When you have finished building and are ready to hand over your work to your client, consider how well your project, as a whole, has satisfied these higher, more abstract levels of evaluation. If you feel that you have done a good job on all four levels, then you can be reasonably confident that you have designed, executed and delivered something of value. 9.5 Go to client Your client should be an active participant throughout your project’s lifetime, providing valuable input and feedback that can help keep the project on a successful trajectory. We recommend engaging with your client frequently, if only for brief updates: it will give them the reassurance that comes from having a better understanding of what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, and it will help you to ensure that your decisions and plans are aligned with their expectations. It is interesting to note that some large organisations have recently started seating AI departments in close proximity to the CEO and other decision-makers. This is driven by anecdotal findings that casual interactions with AI practitioners can increase AI-favourable decision-making. While this observation may not stand up to the statistical rigour needed for causal inference, the takeway is still valuable: increasing your interactions with decision-makers will likely be beneficial to both you and them. 9.5.1 The client’s role Sometimes clients or managers mistakenly believe that their role is to give you their requirements, data and infrastructure so that you can go away and silently build a product that is exactly what they imagined. Naturally, this is misguided: data science projects are complex and involve many decisions. While you may know the dataset and problem well, you will not be in a position to understand the business case as well as the project owner or other stakeholders. Some decisions are yours to make, but the responsibility for others lies squarely with the client. You should not try to make these decisions on your own. If your client resists, you should make every attempt to get them to understand that data science projects require an iterative process and that the more that you can get their feedback, the more the final product will meet their requirements. 9.5.2 Your relationship with your client Some find client interactions to be difficult and stressful; even the easiest of these relationships can become strained when a project does not go according to plan. One of the most common barriers to building a good relationship with your client is face time: people are busy and you might feel uncomfortable asking for their time. As mentioned above, you may find that your client does not want to be involved, or thinks that they don’t have much to contribute. Quite the contrary is true in reality: their involvement is crucial for project success. We recommend you emphasise this point early in your working relationship and make sure that your client knows the expectations you have for their involvement. However too much client involvement can also be detrimental. Some clients can be overbearing and may want to be more engaged than is helpful. They may have short attention spans, changing the aims of the project so often that your project trajectory looks more like a tangle of yarn than a linear progression. They may even feel that they know better than you about what is best for the project, and while this may be true in some cases and you should keep an open mind to this possibility, more often than not this stems from a lack of understanding and a large amount of nervousness. If you have followed our advice until now, you should have established a working relationship with your client already. However, during this phase of the project, the work takes on a different form and the way you and your client interact may also change. For this reason, we encourage you to be explicit with them about when and how you will meet. In other words, set clear boundaries. For example, agree on when you will give updates so that you can don’t spend too much time in meetings. Establishing such things early on will go a long way towards building a solid, trusting relationship. 9.5.3 Planning and running meetings Once you have convinced stakeholders of the importance of their involvement, you should plan regular meetings with them. To keep these meetings going, you need to make them see that the meetings are valuable to them, so use the time provided effectively. You can do this by planning the meeting and taking ownership over the agenda. It is a good idea to prepare slides with any findings you have uncovered, visual representations of what you are working on or simply a list of questions to go through. People tend to be able to focus better on the problem at hand when they have something to look at. 9.5.4 Building a good client relationship Your client or manager will have a vision that they need to realise. Your job is to transform that vision into something tangible. Their vision may not be exactly what you end up delivering; in some ways it might be better and in other ways worse. Data science projects are full of tradeoffs, so you and your client will invariably have to make choices from time to time. A common hurdle is that your client will likely not understand technical challenges and the trade-offs that you make. It is essential, therefore, that you get buy-in for the decisions that must be made. This is not always easy; we suggest you emphasise how your decisions affect the outcome of the project in terms of tangible results and business value – the things your client cares most about. It’s important to bear in mind that you and your client have different vocabularies. This is a surprisingly common obstacle to building a trusting relationship because it impedes communication and, in the worst cases, can lead to different understandings of project objectives. Often the onus is on you, the data scientist, to bridge this gap by adapting to their terms and terminology. You should not be shy about asking stakeholders to define or clarify terminology so that you both understand one another. Don’t assume that you can necessarily look up terms you don’t know later or that you and your counterpart are using the same definition of a word. If you feel there may be room for ambiguity, it’s important to clarify this from the start. Make notes of these definitions and use them when you talk to the project stakeholders. Of course, your relationship with you client is a two-way street, so you should also be prepared to share some of your knowledge with other project stakeholders. Most clients will welcome this (within limits). However we urge you to bear in mind that ignorance can be disorienting and disempowering, especially to a client. It’s important to be empathetic to this and to avoid being arrogant or patronising. Instead, focus on the collaborative aspect and choose your words in a way that states that you can learn from each other. Everyone does have different knowledge and knowledge sharing is in general very powerful. The more that people understand how machine learning works the more they will understand the challenges you face and how their knowledge can improve the outcome. An important tool to use when speaking to your client is repetition. Repeating what you have heard in your own words can help build trust because it shows that have understood the problem and that this understanding is important to you. For instance, a good habit can be to describe the business problem you are solving with the exact words your client has used. This shows that you have understood, it give your client an opportunity to clarify or correct and, by using their language, it reduces their cognitive load. Again, a lot of these tricks come down to empathy for your client. When dealing with other people, it is important to remain kind, positive and in control of your emotions. Especially when situations become difficult. Dealing with high demanding clients can be extremely frustrating and stressful. It can be good to remember that the situation is probably more stressful for them than it is for you. Management also has targets to meet and they are ultimately responsible for the success of the project even though the execution is out of their control. Empathise with them and make them feel in control by involving them in the process as much as possible. It helps to always remain positive but realistic when speaking about your project as this gives hope without overselling your deliverables. Whenever problems do occur don’t avoid them, they don’t go away just because you don’t discuss them. This is the main reason why projects fail: challenges aren’t communicated or addressed early on. Rather than see it as a problem, tackle it as a challenge, make a plan and present this new plan in a positive light. It is important to never go to your client without a plan and expect them to help you figure out how your project can be saved. Your client needs results and if the results they are expecting are impossible to obtain, make a Plan B and figure out how you could still provide value. Your client wants to know that you are the best choice to work with and that you can overcome challenges and tackle them effectively. Tackling problems can allow you to show your true creativity, ensuring that you remain their first choice on future projects. 9.6 Summary In this chapter we have discussed the meat of a data science project, where you execute the development of a solution and build a product. It includes processes such as researching various approaches, experimenting with prototypes, choosing a single best option and building it into well-developed product that aligns with the business and project objectives. For most projects, this is an iterative process of one form or another. For example, during prototyping, you will likely iterate through various possible approaches. Similarly, as you build, you will test different ways to optimise your model and your final product, using carefully selected assessment criteria to guide your decisions. Not all of these attempts will yield improvements, but the overall process should move you towards a final solution that is the best you can create given your constraints. This raises an important point: you will almost always be limited in the resources that are available to you – time, money, compute power, etc – so you will often have to be pragmatic about how you best use the resources you have. It’s often a strategic choice; you simply have to do the best with the resources you have. In the wise words of Gandalf: “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” (Tolkien 1954) As a data scientist, you are your client’s guide and are responsible for seeing the project through to completion. While this is not always an easy job, if you define success correctly, plan, execute and communicate effectively then you will give yourself the greatest chance to succeed. References "],
["handover.html", "10 Phase 6: Handover and knowledge transfer Finding a new owner", " 10 Phase 6: Handover and knowledge transfer Finding a new owner Sometimes this phase is simple: if, for instance, the project aim is insight or the deliverable is a report, then nothing further needs to be done. However for more complex projects this, can be the most difficult phase. If you are creating a system, remember to deploy the solution according to the plan. It is often not enough to hand over source code as crucial details are often in the deployment. Does your solution scale? Make sure to stress test your application so that it doesn’t crash unexpectedly. For the long term success of any project, there must be a long term strategy in place. The software will always need to be maintained and depending on what you developed models might ingest new data and the results will slowly start to drift over time. How will the organisation deal with this? Is there a plan in place to maintain these models over time and who will do this? The concept ‘drift’ explained In the most challenging of data analysis applications, data evolves and must be analyzed in near real-time. Patterns and relations in such data often evolve, thus, models built for analyzing such data quickly become obsolete over time. In machine learning and data mining, this phenomenon is referred to as drift. To combat drift, a model should be thoroughly analysed and a decision needs to be made on how frequently a model should be re-trained in order to remain relevant. Oftentimes those that develop a system are not those that need to maintain it long term. This by itself might cause many issues but to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible be sure to write clear concise code, following coding standards, writing detailed documentation and having decent test coverage. Regarding documentation, it is best practice to write your comments and documentation alongside the actual code. Doing this will mean your documentation is more likely to stay up to date. If documentation is in a different location than the code, then a developer making changes would also need to remember to update the documentation. Many great tools can generate beautiful looking documentation from comments added in your code. For python, we can highly recommend Sphynx as it is widely used and gives you loads of great styles to choose from. Regarding proper coding style, we recommend you follow PEP8 for python and for R, the R style guide. We recommend you install a linter into your text editor so that your code will be constantly checked against these coding standards. Coding standards make your code far more readable so it is recommended to adhere to them as much as possible, We also find it useful to use a formatter, for python we use Black. This will automatically format your python code to meet the PEP8 guidelines. You will never need to worry about code formatting again as a formatter can automatically add the correct spacing, line breaks and other coding standards. It is, however, important to note that once you use a formatter, you can’t realistically override the formatting and you will need to accept some style changes as is. Every time you run your formatter these changes will be undone so there is no point sticking to your preferred format. When you reach the end of your project, find the person responsible for maintaining the system and run through how it works. Do a complete handover running through both the code and the documentation, adding comments and notes to clarify points that are not clear to the person you are handing over to. If handover to an actual person is not possible for whatever reason, for example if a permanent data scientist is not yet hired, then make sure you make your documentation as clear as possible. Do not leave it to chance and write it as if you are writing for a very junior person. More documentation is recommended in these cases. Make sure the test cases are understood and implemented in such a way that they are run regularly. There are plenty of continuous integration tools that do this for you. This will stop any performance altering changes from taking place. To avoid the negative consequences of model drift, recalculate the model performance on new data regularly. "],
["phasesSummary.html", "11 Summary of project phases", " 11 Summary of project phases In this chapter, we have given you a lot of information about how we approach the projects that we design and execute. We hope that you find our suggestions useful. Naturally, projects come in different sizes and scopes, and whether or not all of these phases are appropriate for a given project depends on many factors. While we have presented project evaluation and project phases as different concepts, in actuality they go hand-in-hand. We encourage you to think about the levels of project evaluation as you go through the phases of project design. As we saw in Chapter 2, the levels of project evaluation are hierarchical. They also have a temporal component, by which mean that one should think about the higher levels during the earlier phases of a project when the business case is being discussed. The lower levels, such as the project process phase come more into consideration during the later phases of scoping, execution and handover. To illustrate this point, we have combined the earlier two figures into the figure before. Figure 11.1: Combined project evaluation and phases "],

Indeed, contracting has many advantages over permanent roles – it can give you flexibility in your work schedule, the ability to choose what work you do and the gratification that comes with having built a business on your own, to name just a few. But to have a viable business, you have to have customers, and exactly how to find those customers is an important question for any business. This chapter is aimed at those who would like to establish themselves as independent data scientists and data science consultants and provides advice and learnings from our own experiences as contractors. Starting a business comes with many challenges and there are many good resources on entrepreneurship readily available. We will focus our attention primarily on the unique aspects of operating a data science consulting practice. 12.2 Finding clients and helping clients find you Perhaps the single question we are asked the most is, “How do I get clients?” It would be nice to be able to point to a concrete resource – a specific website with an easy-to-complete form – that functions as the freelancer analogue of a job application form. Such resources do exist – platforms where companies can post their data science needs and where contractors apply (bid) for the work. This can be a great way to find projects and to build up your data science portfolio, especially when you are starting as a freelancer. In time, however, your role may evolve to include consulting, encompassing a lot of what we have covered in this book. In this case, many of your clients will not have a defined project, and an important part of your role will be to define and design the project based on the client’s needs. Such projects rarely appear as advertised tenders on these platforms, so you have to find them through other means. So how do you find such contracts? In the case of your authors, the contracts usually found us. This is both reassuring and disconcerting: reassuring in the knowledge that you may not have to invest a lot of time and energy into obtaining work, and disconcerting in the fact that until the work starts coming to you, you are a little bit stuck. But that doesn’t mean that you are powerless – there are several steps you can take to help your prospective clients discover you and show why they should hire you. 12.2.1 Build a network The single best way to grow your business is through word-of-mouth referrals, so it’s critically important to create a professional network. A network is a group of relationships, and you should view your professional contacts as relationships that you want to nurture and develop. While you can not guarantee that another person will want to have a professional relationship with you, in our experience, most people are very happy to meet others and grow their networks. For many of us, networking doesn’t come naturally, and the prospect of having to strike up a conversation with strangers can be intimidating. Often the advice you hear is along the lines of, “Just get over it”, a sentiment which is both lacking in empathy and myopically unhelpful for many. Unfortunately, we don’t have a magic solution for this, but we can tell you that networking is a skill like any other and that it gets easier the more you do it. If you find it difficult, the best advice we can give you is to practice: go out on a limb and try to strike up a conversation with strangers you meet. For example, if you see someone standing alone at an event, try to strike up a conversation; most likely, they would welcome you making an effort to engage them. Many people like to approach networking as a chance to step outside of themselves: if no one knows you, then you can use this as a chance to take on a different version of yourself that you don’t normally tap into. This is not to say that you should be insincere or untrue to yourself, but rather to not feel the pressure of self-consciousness. Many find this strangely liberating. You should bear in mind that in professional contexts, most people are going through the same thing you are: they want to meet people and grow their networks, but may not feel entirely comfortable doing so. At the end of the day, consulting is a people business, and you need to learn to talk to people who may be very different from yourself. In other words, cast a wide net and practice the skill of bridging a communication gap between yourself and someone with a completely different background or role. Data science is an exciting field with a vibrant, dynamic community. Most cities have regular Meetups and with the recent COVID-19-induced social distancing measures, many of these have been transformed into virtual formats that can help to remove geographical barriers. We strongly recommend that you find a Meetup or two that aligns with your interests and get involved. Similarly, conferences can also be a great way to meet people. Both Meetups and conferences can give you a chance to speak, and many have built-in systems to promote people who are at the early stages of their careers, such as lightning talks or travel scholarships for more junior people or those from underrepresented groups. 12.2.2 Promote yourself While self-promotion may feel unnatural, it is important to get the word out into the world that you exist, that you do good work and that you bring value to your clients. Ideally, your amazing work will speak for itself, but the reality is that many people do amazing work, and you need to make your amazing work stand out. There are several ways to promote yourself. One is to produce content that the world can ingest. For instance, presenting at conferences can be a great way to showcase what you’ve done and to give the audience a glimpse into your personality. Writing is also a good approach, although writing is often time-consuming and many of us struggle to find the time needed to do it well (including your authors). Social media can also be a good way to promote yourself, especially within a data science community that is notoriously engaged in on-line discussions. This notion was elegantly encapsulated by Chris Albon, who tweeted, “Facebook is your family newsletter. LinkedIn is your resume. Twitter is the bar after the conference that perfectly matches your interests.” For more concrete suggestions about how to promote yourself and develop a strong profile, we strongly recommend Build a Career in Data Science by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis. 12.2.3 Have a strong profile As a contractor, you will rarely use your CV to find clients. In its place will be your online profile, and it’s essential that you take the time to create one that is engaging, informative and approachable. Take the time to create a LinkedIn profile that succinctly describes what you have to offer. Often our profiles evolve – the typical approach is to periodically add items to an existing profile that we were once happy with. This can result in a disjointed patchwork of items with no clear narrative. While it can be heartbreaking to remove achievements from the past, your profile must be current and relevant. For example, if you have entered data science after a career as an academic researcher, you may be tempted to include details of your graduate research and your publications. Most prospective clients will not care about this, and the result is a profile that looks unprofessional and lacking in substance and focus. Instead, focus on your achievements that are relevant to your data science career. Having a website or a blog is also a good way to showcase your skills and expertise, as well as a convenient way to list original content. We encourage you to update your profile regularly and keep it as relevant and current as possible. As above, Robinson and Nolis provide a wealth of suggestions for how to do this. 12.2.4 Get involved with your community, both locally and internationally A great way to expand your professional network is through community involvement. For example, the R for Data Science Online Learning Community (https://www.rfordatasci.com/) is an active group of nearly 6000 R enthusiasts who discuss R programming at all levels of expertise, have designated mentors who volunteer time for office hours to help others and who have several ongoing book clubs for people with common interests. For data scientists using the python stack, there are regular Pydata Meetups and conferences globally as well as other ways to get involved. Such communities can be wonderful ways to get involved with others who have shared interests and to improve your craft. We also recommend contributing to open-source software projects. For many who are new to the field, this can seem like something that is well beyond your expertise. However, many projects or packages rely on input from the community to maintain their work, and even contributions such as grammatical corrections, fixed typos or bug fixes are gratefully received. Many repositories will invite contributions at different levels and will even flag issues that are better-suited to those who are new to open source contributing. 12.3 The realities of consulting When embarking on consulting it is important to remember that you are not applying for jobs, rather you are building relationships and partnerships where you align your goals on projects. In a way, you are creating your job. These opportunities often come about because your skills satisfy a very specific set of requirements: you provide a level of expertise that the client wants and, hopefully, you have a demonstrated track record of delivering good work. However, even if you have the right skills, expertise and track-record, you may not necessarily be the right fit for every client or project. It’s important to remember that even for large companies, the people who make decisions are…well…people. Gut feeling and matching temperament will have a large impact on how decisions are made: sometimes they will work in your favour and sometimes they won’t. When building your business, some things are within your control and some things are not. You can’t control how prospective clients are going to make their decisions, naturally. But you can control how you present yourself to them, and having a realistic picture of how you can help them overcome their business challenges will go a long way in showing that you deserve their business. At its core, consulting is about improving the position of your client – creating value and showing stakeholders the value you can add. Therefore, when you work with a potential client, it’s important to convey that you are a problem-solver. The business problems you will face are often less defined and less structured than you might be used to. As we have discussed throughout this book, that puts more responsibility on your shoulders to create something valuable. But that also allows you to be creative in how you design a solution. While it may be daunting, it’s also incredibly exciting. Naturally, you also need to be technically sound. You should have the skills to deliver good work on time and within budget. As your career progresses, referrals will become increasingly important for capturing new clients, so be sure that those who know your work will be in a position to say good things about it. As a side-note, your technical development is an ongoing process that will never be complete. This field moves fast and changes frequently, so be sure to make time to keep up with current trends and improve your skills and knowledge. Think of this time as an investment in yourself. In the early stages of your career, you will likely be desperate for work and eager to take any job that comes your way. That can be opposed by a concern that taking a job without being 100% sure about how you would deliver a successful outcome can be risky. Both feelings are normal and, with experience, you will become more comfortable with committing to work when you are not 100% sure of how to deliver it. You have to strike a balance between ambition and safety, and exactly where that balance lies for you is something that only you know. We often tell our students that, with experience, they will start to develop a faith in the process of data science – in the fact that the solutions to these uncertainties will be revealed naturally through the work itself, so long as you do the work well. You should always remember that a contract for a project is not unidirectional: you, as well as your client, also play an active role in the decision to take a partnership forward. Some clients are difficult, and you will most likely encounter some that you are not willing to work with. You have a right to be selective in whom you work with and in what you expect from your client; if a client relationship is likely to be difficult or draining, you should be prepared to turn the work down. No one wants to renege on an agreement and it is much easier to turn work down than to walk away after a project has started, so keep your eyes open when first interacting with a potential client and don’t ignore it if your instincts tell you that the relationship will not be a good one. 12.4 Freelancing versus permanent roles Many of our students are drawn to the notion of working independently. Indeed, freelancing can be a dynamic and exhilarating way to make a living. It gives you flexibility, almost always comes with great variety in terms of the work you do and allows you to be your own boss. Permanent roles can also be dynamic and exhilarating, although it’s fair to say that they are less flexible than freelancing and rarely allow you to be your own boss. Which type of role is right for you? Naturally, that’s a question only you can answer. To help you to better understand the realities of these two paths, we discuss below some aspects that you may not have considered. 12.4.1 Flexibility While freelancing does afford you the ability to pick and choose what work you do and the flexibility to work when and where you want to, this notion can become romanticised and may not always be realistic, especially for early-career data scientists. Many clients expect you to work normal business hours and will want to have you on-sight. While remote working is becoming increasingly accepted, the buy-in is not 100%. Furthermore, some companies will have strict legal restrictions on where their data can be used; the financial services industry is a notable example. When trying to build a business, you are often so focused on getting work that you will paradoxically have less freedom than someone in a permanent position. In other words, until your business is established, your need to build a client base and generate revenue can drive you to take nearly any job. While we don’t recommend you take work out of desperation, it is often the case that early-stage freelancers have less flexibility than expected. As your business grows, so will your ability to adopt a more flexible system of work. The flexibility of freelancing is real and it can be fantastically liberating. But it may not be as easy to realise as you might expect. 12.4.2 Variety Freelancing can be a great way to work on a wide range of problems. That said, many permanent roles also come with high degrees of variety. While you may not have as much freedom to decide exactly which problems you choose to work on, you may find that you are exposed to other aspects of the business in a permanent role that you might not otherwise have access to as a freelancer. For example, many senior data scientists will become responsible for leading teams, with a career trajectory that moves towards roles that are more strategic and managerial than hands-on. The skills required for such a role are much different from those technical skills required for a job that is more focused on coding. As a freelancer, unless you want to expand your business to include staff, you would not have this sort of exposure. Of course, managerial roles are not right for everyone and are not a necessary eventuality, but the point remains that permanent roles may give you different types of variety than you may get as an independent contractor. 12.4.3 Job stability One of the major differences between operating as an independent contractor and being a permanent member of staff lies in job stability. As a freelancer, you are responsible for your own stability and for determining what sort of spending runway you would like to have for your business. Of course, no business is 100% safe from economic instability, however, companies do tend to provide more stability than does the market for short-term contracts. If such stability is important to you, this may be an important factor to consider. Similarly, different types of companies differ widely in their stability. In general, larger, more established companies will be more stable as compared to small companies and start-ups. Naturally, there are no certainties. For instance, in 2007 we saw a massive financial crisis in which numerous “too big to fail” companies went bankrupt. Of the many sectors available, government/civil service roles are among the most stable, although again, this is not a certainty. Similarly, permanent roles will often come with benefits that can be massively important as well. For example, planning for your retirement is hugely important and should never be ignored, but it is something that many early-career professionals tend to overlook. As an independent contractor, it will be up to you to plan for your retirement. Similarly, in many countries, health insurance is provided by your job, at least in part. This can be a benefit that could translate into immense amounts of money if you need health care, and its importance should not be overlooked. Relatedly, your ability to borrow money will be affected by your employment position. In the UK, for instance, it is difficult to be considered for a mortgage unless you have at least three years of positive financial records for your operation to support your application. If buying property is on your radar, this could be an important factor in your decision. 12.4.4 Legal considerations and responsibilities Whenever you get paid for a service, it is important to protect yourself legally. As an independent contractor, this usually means having indemnity insurance. While indemnity insurance is not usually expensive to purchase, not having it can be very costly should things go wrong. Many freelancers choose to operate as a limited liability company. One advantage of this arrangement is that there exists a legal distinction between you (the person doing the work) and the company. If a client wants to sue you, for example, only the company is liable (unless you, as an individual, are grossly negligent). This gives you a layer of protection…legally your possessions are protected, and only the assets of the company are vulnerable. In the UK (where both of us registered our companies), the process of setting up a company is fairly straightforward. However, there are certain legal aspects of running a company that you have to be aware of. Our advice is to find an accountant who can help you set up the company, advise on the financial operations and oversee payroll and adherence to tax and other legal obligations. Operating as a business can have another benefit that is important to understand. In the UK, if a contractor works for a client in what looks like a permanent role, the government can stipulate that the person essentially is a permanent employee and should be granted all the benefits of a regular employee. For example, if you are working on a 12-month full-time contract, you will look just like a permanent member of staff. This leaves the client in a vulnerable position as they could be liable to pay back-taxes and national insurance contributions should the government deem it appropriate. For this reason, many clients will not work with sole traders – those who operate individually outside of the context of a company. If, on the other hand, you operate as a limited liability company, then legally you already have employment (you are employed by your own company) and your client will not be at-risk. The net effect is that you may find it easier to get contracts as a limited company than as a sole trader. Those who are employed in permanent positions, in contrast to independent contractors (sole traders or limited companies) will generally be protected by the legal framework of their employer, so these legal issues are generally eliminated.
